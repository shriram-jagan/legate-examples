    "# Learning Outcomes\n",
    "This example teaches how to compute the solution for systems of equations in two variables using NumPy. There are two equations, $f_{1}(x,y)$ and $f_{2}(x, y)$, with two variables each, $x$ and $y$. We seek to find a solution that satisfies these two equations using Newton's method. To understand Newton's method in multiple dimensions, please see [this](https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/_media/tma4125/2017v/newton.pdf) note by Markus Grasmair.\n",
